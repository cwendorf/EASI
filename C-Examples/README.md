### Overview of the Examples

- Examples are from the _[Introduction to the New Statistics ](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_ (Cumming & Calin-Jageman, 2017)
- The examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

The following are examples for two-group and paired-samples designs (see _[ITNS](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_, Ch. 7-8).

- The [**PenLaptop**](./PenLaptop/) files analyze examples of a two-group between-subjects design (independent-groups)
- The [**Thomason**](./Thomason/) files analyze examples of a within-subjects design for two time points (paired samples)

The following are examples for single-factor designs (see _[ITNS](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_, Ch. 14).

- The [**Rattan**](./Rattan/) files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design 
- The [**Donohue**](./Donohue/) files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design  

The following are examples for two-factor designs (see _[ITNS](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_, Ch. 15).

- The [**Frenda**](./Frenda/) files analyze an example of a two-factor between-subjects design
