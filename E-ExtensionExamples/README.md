# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## Extended Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Extended Examples

- Extended example files for between-subjects designs and for within-subjects designs are included
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Extended Examples

The [**EXTENDED_BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED_BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_EXAMPLE.md) document and associated files include:

- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to uncorrected t tests among all levels of a factor)
- Analyses of Set of Contrasts (equivalent to dummy, effect, and other sets of contrasts among all levels of a factor)

The [**EXTENDED_WITHIN_SUBJECTS_EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED_WITHIN_SUBJECTS_EXAMPLE.md) document and associated files include:

- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to uncorrected t tests among of all instances of a variable)
- Analyses of Set of Contrasts (equivalent to dummy, effect, and other sets of codes among all instances of a variable)
