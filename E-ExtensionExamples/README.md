## Extended Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Extended Examples

- Extended example files for between-subjects designs and for within-subjects designs are included
- The examples are duplicated using raw data input and summary statistics input
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Extended Examples

The following are examples for single-factor designs.

- The [**ExtendedBetweenSubjects**](./ExtendedBetweenSubjects/) documents and files analyze an extended example of a single-factor between-subjects design 
- The [**ExtendedWithinSubjects**](./ExtendedWithinSubjects/) documents and files analyze an extended example of a single-factor within-subjects design
