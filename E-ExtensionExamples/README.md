# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## Basic Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Examples

- Basic example files for between-subjects desgins and for within-subjects designs are included
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

The **ExtendedBetweenSubjects** files include:

- Analyses of Set of Contrasts (equivalent to dummy, effect, and other sets of contrasts among all levels of a factor)
- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to Tukey LSD pairwise comparisons among all levels of a factor)

The **ExtendedWithinSubjects** files include:

- Analyses of Set of Contrasts (equivalent to dummy, effect, and other sets of codes among all instances of a variable)
- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to Tukey LSD pairwise comparisons of all instances of a variable)
