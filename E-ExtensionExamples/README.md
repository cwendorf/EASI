## Extended Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Extended Examples

- Extended example files for between-subjects designs and for within-subjects designs are included
- The examples are duplicated using raw data input and summary statistics input
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Extended Examples

The **ExtendedBetweenSubjects** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design. 
The [**EXTENDED_BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED_BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md) uses raw data input.  
The [**EXTENDED_BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED_BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) uses summary statistics input.  
These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to unadjusted t tests among all levels of a factor)

The **ExtendedWithinSubjects** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design.  
The [**EXTENDED_WITHIN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED_WITHIN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md) uses raw data input.  
The [**EXTENDED_WITHIN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED_WITHIN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) uses summary statistics input.  
These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to unadjusted t tests among of all instances of a variable)
