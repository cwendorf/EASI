## Examples from the Introduction to the New Statistics

### Overview of the Examples

- Examples from the [Introduction to the New Statistics (ITNS)](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics") book are included
- Each example contains a data file, a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs
- Additional forms of the data can be obtained from https://github.com/gitrman/itns

### Included Examples

The [**RATTAN_EXAMPLE.md**](./RATTAN_EXAMPLE.md) document and associated files analyze an example of a between-subjects design (from ITNS, CH.14):

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Group Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis of two levels of a factor)
- Analyses of a Group Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all levels of a factor)

The [**DONOHUE_EXAMPLE.md**](./DONOHUE_EXAMPLE.md) document and associated files analyze an example of a within-subjects design (from ITNS, Ch. 14):

- Analyses of Mutiple Variables (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each instance of a variable)
- Analyses of Variable Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis two instances of a variable)
- Analyses of a Variable Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all instances of a variable)
