## Examples from the _Introduction to the New Statistics_

### Overview of the Examples

- Examples from the _[Introduction to the New Statistics (ITNS)](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_ book are included
- The examples are duplicated using raw data input and summary statistics input
- The examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example contains a data file, a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

The **Rattan** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design (from ITNS, Ch. 14).  
The [**RATTAN_DATA_EXAMPLE.md**](./Rattan/RATTAN_DATA_EXAMPLE.md) uses raw data input.  
The [**RATTAN_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./Rattan/RATTAN_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) uses summary statistics input.  
These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Group Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis of two levels of a factor)
- Analyses of a Group Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all levels of a factor)

The **Donohue** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design (from ITNS, Ch. 14).  
The [**DONOHUE_DATA_EXAMPLE.md**](./Donohue/DONOHUE_DATA_EXAMPLE.md) uses raw data input.  
The [**DONOHUE_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./Donohue/DONOHUE_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) uses summary statistics input.  
These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Mutiple Variables (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each instance of a variable)
- Analyses of Variable Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis two instances of a variable)
- Analyses of a Variable Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all instances of a variable)

The **Frenda** documents and files analyze and example of a two-factor between-subjects design (from ITNS, Ch. 15).  
The [**FRENDA_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./Frenda/FRENDA_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) uses summary statistics input.  
These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Multiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses of each level of the design)
- Analyses of Marginal Means (equivalent to one-sample analyses of the marginal means)
- Analyses of Main Effects (equivalent to a comparison analysis of marginal means for each factor in the design)
- Analyses of the Interaction (equivalent to comparisons analysis of the simple effects)
