## Between-Subjects Example with Frenda Statistics

### Overview of this Example

This example is from the _[Introduction to the New Statistics (ITNS)](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_
- The example uses only summary statistics input
- The example includes estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- The example contains a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Details of this Example

The **Frenda** documents and files analyze and example of a two-factor between-subjects design (from ITNS, Ch. 15).  
The [**FRENDA_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./FRENDA_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) file uses summary statistics input.  
These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Multiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses of each level of the design)
- Analyses of Marginal Means (equivalent to one-sample analyses of the marginal means)
- Analyses of Main Effects (equivalent to a comparison analysis of marginal means for each factor in the design)
- Analyses of the Interaction (equivalent to comparisons analysis of the simple effects)
