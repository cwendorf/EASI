## Within-Subjects Example with Thomason Data

### Overview of this Example

The **Thomason** documents and files analyze an example of a within-subjects design for two time points (from _[ITNS](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_, Ch. 8).  

- The example is duplicated both using raw data input and summary statistics input
- The example includes estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- The example contains a data file, a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Details of this Example

The [**THOMASON_DATA_EXAMPLE.md**](./THOMASON_DATA_EXAMPLE.md) file uses raw data input.  
The [**THOMASON_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./THOMASON_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) file uses summary statistics input.  

These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Variable Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis two instances of a variable)
- Analyses of Multiple Studies (examples from three different replication studies)

> **Note: Results of these analyses will differ slightly from those in _ITNS_. This is because ESCI and EASI make different statistical assumptions about the data. See the [**Functions**](https://github.com/cwendorf/EASI/tree/master/A-Functions) page for more details.**
