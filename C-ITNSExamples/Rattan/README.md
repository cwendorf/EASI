## Between-Subjects Example with Rattan Data

### Overview of this Example

The **Rattan** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design (from _[ITNS](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")_, Ch. 14).

- The example is duplicated both using raw data input and summary statistics input
- The example includes estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- The example contains a data file, a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Details of this Example

The [**RATTAN-DATA-EXAMPLE.md**](./RATTAN-DATA-EXAMPLE.md) file uses raw data input.  
The [**RATTAN-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md**](./RATTAN-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md) file uses summary statistics input.  

These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Group Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis of two levels of a factor)
- Analyses of a Group Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all levels of a factor)

> **Note: Results of these analyses will differ slightly from those in _ITNS_. This is because ESCI and EASI make different statistical assumptions about the data. See the [**Functions**](https://github.com/cwendorf/EASI/tree/master/A-Functions) page for more details.**
