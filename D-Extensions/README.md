# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## Extensions of the Basic EASI Functions

### Overview of the Extensions

EASI extentions are functions that go beyond the original vision for EASI. The EASI extensions parallel the four basic categories of analyses but add the following:
- **estimateExtensions.R** (scripts that estimate confidence intervals for sets of built-in contrasts and pairwise comparisons)
- **plotExtensions.R** (scripts that plot onfidence intervals for sets of built-in contrasts and pairwise comparisons)
- **effectExtensions.R** (scripts that calculate standardized effect sizes and confidence intervals for sets of built-in contrasts and pairwise comparisons)
- **testExtensions.R** (scripts that calculate NHST for for sets of built-in contrasts and pairwise comparisons)

### Installation of the Functions

EASI is not currently on CRAN or compiled as a package, but you can install it by pasting by pasting the contents of the [**ALL_EXTENSIONS.R**](./ALL_EXTENSIONS.R) file directly into R.

All EASI scripts should be run prior to conducting analyses. Because these are extensions, the basic EASI Functions should also pasted into R.
