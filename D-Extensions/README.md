# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## Extensions of the EASI Functions

### Overview of the Extensions

EASI extentions are functions that go beyond the original vision for EASI. The EASI extensions parallel the four basic categories of analyses but add the following:
- **estimateExtensions.R** (scripts that estimate confidence intervals for pairwise comparisons and sets of built-in contrast codes)
- **plotExtensions.R** (scripts that plot onfidence intervals for pairwise comparisons and sets of built-in contrast codes)
- **testExtensions.R** (scripts that calculate NHST for pairwise comparisons and sets of built-in contrast codes)
- **effectExtensions.R** (scripts that calculate standardized effect sizes and confidence intervals for pairwise comparisons and sets of built-in contrast codes)

### Installation of the Functions and Extensions

Like the basic EASI functions, the EASI extentions are not currently on CRAN or compiled as a package, but you can install them by pasting the contents of the [**ALL_EXTENSIONS.R**](./ALL_EXTENSIONS.R) file directly into R.

Both the basic function and the extensions should both be pasted into R prior to conducting analyses.
