# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## The Functions

### Overview of EASI

- EASI is designed to provide quick calculation of basic statistics.
- EASI emphasizes confidence intervalsand effect sizes (though NHST is included).
- EASI calculates statistics not readily available in other statistics packages.

### For Means and Mean Differences

- Confidence intervals are based on the central t distribution.
- Confidence intervals are calculated independent of each other (they are not simultaneous).
- No adjustments for multiple intervals have been made.

### For Standardized Effect Sizes

- Both Cohen's d and Hedge's g are presented.
- Confidence intervals are centered on g.
- Confidence intervals are based on the noncentral t distribution.
