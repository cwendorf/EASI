## Advanced Applications

### Overview of the Examples

- Examples are from [_Statistics for Social Science: A Sourcebook of Basic Statistical Methods_](https://www4.uwsp.edu/psych/cw/statistics/sourcebook.htm) (Wendorf, 2019)
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes where relevant
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

**Analyze Extension**: These examples combine the estimate, plot, test, and standardize functions for single-factor designs.

- The [**AnalyzeOneWay**](./AnalyzeOneWay/) files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design 
- The [**AnalyzeRepeated**](./AnalyzeRepeated/) files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design

**Summarize Extension**: These examples provide summary statistics, boxplots, and data plots for single-factor designs.

- The [**SummarizeOneWay**](./SummarizeOneWay/) files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design 
- The [**SummarizeRepeated**](./SummarizeRepeated/) files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design 

**Pairwise Extension**: These examples analyze unadjusted paiwise comparisons for single-factor designs.

- The [**PairwiseOneWay**](./PairwiseOneWay/) files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design 
- The [**PairwiseRepeated**](./PairwiseRepeated/) files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design 

**Relational Extension**: These examples provide arelational (standard) and relational (comparative) intervals for single-factor desgins.

- The [**RelationalOneWay**](./RelationalOneWay/) files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design 
- The [**RelationalRepeated**](./RelationalRepeated/) files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design

**By Extension**: These examples apply the estimate, plot, test, and standardize functions separately at levels of the second factor (i.e., simple effects) in a two-factor design.

- The [**FactorialBy**](./FactorialBy/) files analyze an example of a two-factor between-subjects design 
- The [**MixedBy**](./MixedBy/) files analyze an example of a mixed factorial design
