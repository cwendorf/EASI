## Technical Details

### For Means, Mean Differences, and Contrasts

- Confidence intervals are calculated independent of each other (i.e., they are not simultaneous)
- No alpha adjustments for multiple intervals have been made
- All calculations assume heterogenity of variance (see Keppel & Wickens, 2004)

### For Standardized Effect Sizes

- All effect sizes are calculated as standardized comparisons (Cohen's d) or as standardized contrasts (see Bonett, 2008)
- Confidence intervals for standardized comparisons and contrasts are based on Bonett (2008)
