## About the EASI Functions

### Installation of Basic Functions

[**_EASI-Functions.R_**](./EASI-Functions.R) incorporates all of the functions that constitute the original vision of EASI. The EASI functions were written to represent four basic categories of analyses:


|             | Means | Difference | Contrast |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |:---: |
| estimate    |       |            |          |
| plot        |       |            |          |
| test        |       |            |          |
| standardize |       |            |          |
