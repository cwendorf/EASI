## Tutorial Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Examples

- Examples for a variety of research designs are included
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

The following is an example for a one-sample design.

- The [**OneSample**](./OneSample/) files analyze an example of a single-group design.

The following are examples for two-group and paired-samples designs.

- The [**Independent**](./Independent/) files analyze examples of a two-group between-subjects design (independent-groups)
- The [**Paired**](./Paired/) files analyze examples of a within-subjects design for two time points (paired samples)

The following are examples for single-factor designs.

- The [**OneWay**](./OneWay/) files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design
- The [**Repeated**](./Repeated/) files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design

The following are examples for two-factor designs.

- The [**Factorial**](./Factorial/) files analyze an example of a two-factor between-subjects design
- The [**Mixed**](./Mixed) files analyze an example of a two-factor mixed design (one between-subjects and one within-subjects factor)
