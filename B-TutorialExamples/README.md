## Tutorial Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Examples

- Example files for between-subjects designs and for within-subjects designs are included
- The examples are duplicated using raw data input and summary statistics input
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

The following are examples for single-factor designs.

- The [**OneWay**](./OneWay/) documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design
- The [**Repeated**](./Repeated/) documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design

The following are examples for two-factor designs.
- The [**Factorial**](./Factorial/) documents and files analyze an example of a two-factor between-subjects design
- The [**Mixed**](./Mixed) documents and files analyze an example of a mixed design (one between-subjects and one within-subjects factor)
