## Within-Subjects Example with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of this Example

The **SingleWithinSubjects** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor within-subjects design. 

- The example is duplicated both using raw data input and summary statistics input
- The example includes estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- The example contains a data file, a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Details of this Example
  
The [**SINGLE-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-DATA-EXAMPLE.md**](./SINGLE-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-DATA-EXAMPLE.md) file uses raw data input.  
The [**SINGLE-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md**](./SINGLE-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md) file uses summary statistics input.

These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Mutiple Variables (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each instance of a variable)
- Analyses of Variable Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis two instances of a variable)
- Analyses of a Variable Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all instances of a variable)
 
The [**EXTENDED-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-DATA-EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-DATA-EXAMPLE.md) file uses raw data input.  
The [**EXTENDED-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md**](./EXTENDED-WITHIN-SUBJECTS-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md) file uses summary statistics input.

These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to unadjusted t tests among of all instances of a variable)
