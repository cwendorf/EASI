## Factorial Between-Subjects Example

### Overview of the Examples

The **Factorial** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design.

- The example is duplicated both using raw data input and summary statistics input
- The example includes estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- The example contains a data file, a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

The [**FACTORIAL-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md**](./FACTORIAL-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md) file uses summary statistics input.  

These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Multiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses of each level of the design)
- Analyses of Marginal Means (equivalent to one-sample analyses of the marginal means)
- Analyses of Main Effects (equivalent to a comparison analysis of marginal means for each factor in the design)
- Analyses of the Interaction (equivalent to comparisons analysis of the simple effects)
