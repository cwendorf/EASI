# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference

**An R Package for Estimation Statistics**

---

### Overview

EASI is an R package that implements features of [estimation statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics "Estimation Statistics on Wikipedia") (or the ["new statistics"](https://thenewstatistics.com/itns/ "Introduction to the New Statistics")). Primary functions calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean differences, and mean contrasts for between- and within-subjects single-factor, factorial, and mixed designs. They can take either raw data or summary statistics as input. Additional functions calculate the standardized effect sizes and statistical significance tests associated with comparions among the groups and variables.
