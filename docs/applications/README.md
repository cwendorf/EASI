## Advanced Applications

### Overview of the Advanced Applications

The advanced applications represent experimental and undocumented features of EASI. Data for these applications are from a variety of published and simulated sources. In the spirit of experimentation, all applications use pipe operators to identify data sources (rather than using standard R syntax).

### Methods for Combining Analyses

The **Pipes** pages introduce a variety of native and simple pipe operators to implement basic analysis functions:

- [*PipesOneWayDataApplication*](./PipesOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*PipesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./PipesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Analyze** pages use a simple command to provide confidence intervals, significance tests, and standardized effect sizes at the same time:

- [*AnalyzeOneWayDataApplication*](./AnalyzeOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*AnalyzeRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./AnalyzeRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Omnibus and Simple Effects Specification

The **Omnibus** pages provide omnibus analyses in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*OmnibusFactorialDataApplication*](./OmnibusFactorialDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*OmnibusMixedDataApplication*](./OmnibusMixedDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data

The **Exposition** pages implement a exposition pipe operator to simplify the use of subsets (like simple effects) in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*ExpositionFactorialDataApplication*](./ExpositionFactorialDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*ExpositionMixedDataApplication*](./ExpositionMixedDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data

The **FactorialBy** and **MixedBy** pages implement "by" functions designed to replicate the analyses of simple effects in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*FactorialByDataApplication*](./FactorialByDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*MixedByDataApplication*](./MixedByDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data

### Exploratory Data Analyses

The **Frequencies** pages provide basic data plots and frequency distributions for measures or groups:

- [*FrequenciesOneWayDataApplication*](./FrequenciesOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*FrequenciesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./FrequenciesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Exploratory** pages build violin plots, beanplots, and raincloud plots:

- [*ExploratoryOneWayDataApplication*](./ExploratoryOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ExploratoryRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ExploratoryRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Contrast and Comparison Representations

The **Pairwise** pages examine unadjusted pairwise comparisons and Tukey post hoc comparisons using traditional confidence interval plots and diffograms:

- [*PairwiseOneWayDataApplication*](./PairwiseOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*PairwiseRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./PairwiseRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Relational** pages examine means and mean differences using the concepts of relational and arelational intervals (Wendorf, 2012):

- [*RelationalOneWayDataApplication*](./RelationalOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*RelationalRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./RelationalRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Complex** pages analyze differences between two contrasts on the same measures or groups:

- [*ComplexOneWayDataApplication*](./ComplexOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ComplexRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ComplexRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Advanced and Custom Plotting

The **Contrasts** pages add data, plausibility curves, and other information to confidence interval plots of contrasts:

- [*ContrastsOneWayDataApplication*](./ContrastsOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ContrastsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ContrastsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Passthrough** pages use of passthrough capabilities and pipe operators to build plots that combine various elements:

- [*PassthroughOneWayDataApplication*](./PassthroughOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*PassthroughRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./PassthroughRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Theme** pages enhance different types of plots with EASI color themes:

- [*ThemeOneWayDataApplication*](./ThemeOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ThemeRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ThemeRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data
