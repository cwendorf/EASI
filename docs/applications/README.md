### Data and Distributions

**Frequencies** - Provide basic data plots, frequency distributions, and summary statistics for measures or groups:

- [*FrequenciesOneWayDataExample*](./FrequenciesOneWayDataExample.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*FrequenciesRepeatedMeasuresDataExample*](./FrequenciesRepeatedMeasuresDataExample.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

**Exploratory** - Use advanced methods to build exploratory data analysis plots that combine or layer various elements:

- [*ExploratoryOneWayDataExample*](./ExploratoryOneWayDataExample.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ExploratoryRepeatedMeasuresDataExample*](./ExploratoryRepeatedMeasuresDataExample.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Contrast and Comparison Representations

**Plausible** - Adds data and plausibility curves to confidence interval plots of comparisons and contrasts:

- [*PlausibleOneWayDataApplication*](./PlausibleOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*PlausibleRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./PlausibleRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

**Complex** - Analyze differences between two contrasts on the same measures or groups:

- [*ComplexOneWayDataApplication*](./ComplexOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ComplexRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ComplexRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

**Pairwise** - Examine unadjusted pairwise comparisons and Tukey post hoc comparisons using traditional confidence interval plots, relational interval plots, and diffograms:

- [*PairwiseOneWayDataApplication*](./PairwiseOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*PairwiseRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./PairwiseRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Analyses of Factorial and Mixed Data

**Effects** - Automate the analyses of simple effects in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*EffectsFactorialDataApplication*](./EffectsFactorialDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*EffectsMixedDataApplication*](./EffectsMixedDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data

**Interaction** - Examine interactions and interaction contrasts in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*InteractionFactorialDataApplication*](./InteractionFactorialDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*InteractionMixedDataApplication*](./InteractionMixedDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data
