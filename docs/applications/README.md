## Advanced Applications

### Overview of the Applications

Data and summary statistics for these applications are from a variety of published and simulated sources.

- Applications represent advanced and undocumented features of EASI
- Applications demonstrate additional published statistical procedures

### Exploratory Data Analysis

The **ExploratoryAnalyses** files analyze applications of boxplots, violin plots, beanplots, rainclouds, and colors:

- [*ExploratoryAnalysesOneWayDataApplications*](./ExploratoryAnalysesOneWayDataApplications.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ExploratoryAnalysesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications*](./ExploratoryAnalysesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Enhanced Plots with Native Pipe Operators

The **EnhancedPlots** files analyze applications of confidence interval plots, diamond plots, and plausibility curves (and colors!) using pipe operators:

- [*EnhancedPlotsOneWayDataApplications*](./EnhancedPlotsOneWayDataApplications.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*EnhancedPlotsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications*](./EnhancedPlotsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Complex Contrasts and the Difference Between Contrasts

The **ComplexContrasts** files analyze complex contrasts (and their differences):

- [*ComplexContrastsOneWayDataApplications*](./ComplexContrastsOneWayDataApplications.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ComplexContrastsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications*](./ComplexContrastsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Relational Intervals

The **RelationalIntervals** files examine the concept of relational and arelational intervals (Wendorf, 2012):

- [*RelationalIntervalsOneWayDataApplications*](./RelationalIntervalsOneWayDataApplications.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*RelationalIntervalsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications*](./RelationalIntervalsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplications.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### By Functions for Simple Effects

The **FactorialBy**  and **MixedBy** files implement "by" functions designed to facilitate the analyses of simple effects in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*FactorialByDataApplications*](./FactorialByDataApplications.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*MixedByDataApplications*](./MixedByDataApplications.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data
