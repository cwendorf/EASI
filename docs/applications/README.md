## Advanced Applications

### Overview of the Advanced Applications

The advanced applications represent experimental and undocumented features of EASI. Data for these applications are from a variety of published and simulated sources. In the spirit of experimentation, all applications use pipe operators to identify data sources (rather than using standard R syntax).

### Pipes and Operators to Combine Analyses

The **Pipes** pages introduce a variety of simple pipe operators to implement basic analysis functions:

- [*PipesOneWayDataApplication*](./PipesOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*PipesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./PipesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Exposition** pages explain the use of the exposition operator in analyzing defined data frames:

- [*ExpositionOneWayDataApplication*](./ExpositionOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ExpositionRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ExpositionRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Analyze** pages use a simple command to provide confidence intervals, significance tests, and standardized effect sizes at the same time:

- [*AnalyzeOneWayDataApplication*](./AnalyzeOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*AnalyzeRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./AnalyzeRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Enhanced and Custom Plotting

The **Frequencies** pages provide basic data plots and frequency distributions for measures or groups:

- [*FrequenciesOneWayDataApplication*](./FrequenciesOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*FrequenciesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./FrequenciesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Exploratory** pages build violin plots, beanplots, and raincloud plots:

- [*ExploratoryOneWayDataApplication*](./ExploratoryOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ExploratoryRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ExploratoryRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Layers** pages use advanced methods to build plots that combine various elements:

- [*LayersOneWayDataApplication*](./LayersOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*LayersRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./LayersRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Themes** pages enhance different types of plots with colors and color themes:

- [*ThemesOneWayDataApplication*](./ThemesOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ThemesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ThemesRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Contrast and Comparison Representations

The **Contrasts** pages add data, plausibility curves, and other information to confidence interval plots of contrasts:

- [*ContrastsOneWayDataApplication*](./ContrastsOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ContrastsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ContrastsRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Complex** pages analyze differences between two contrasts on the same measures or groups:

- [*ComplexOneWayDataApplication*](./ComplexOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*ComplexRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./ComplexRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Pairwise** pages examine unadjusted pairwise comparisons and Tukey post hoc comparisons using traditional confidence interval plots and diffograms:

- [*PairwiseOneWayDataApplication*](./PairwiseOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*PairwiseRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./PairwiseRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

The **Relational** pages examine means and mean differences using the concepts of relational and arelational intervals (Wendorf, 2012):

- [*RelationalOneWayDataApplication*](./RelationalOneWayDataApplication.md) - Uses one-way (between-subjects) data
- [*RelationalRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication*](./RelationalRepeatedMeasuresDataApplication.md) - Uses repeated measures (within-subjects) data

### Analyses of Factorial and Mixed Data

The **Omnibus** pages provide omnibus analyses in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*OmnibusFactorialDataApplication*](./OmnibusFactorialDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*OmnibusMixedDataApplication*](./OmnibusMixedDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data

The **Effects** pages implement a exposition pipe operator to analyze simple effects in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*EffectsFactorialDataApplication*](./EffectsFactorialDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*EffectsMixedDataApplication*](./EffectsMixedDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data

The **By** pages implement "by" functions designed to automate the analyses of simple effects in factorial and mixed designs:

- [*ByFactorialDataApplication*](./ByFactorialDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way factorial (between-subjects) data
- [*ByMixedDataApplication*](./ByMixedDataApplication.md) - Uses two-way mixed design (between-subjects and within-subjects) data
