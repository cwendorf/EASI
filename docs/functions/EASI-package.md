## Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference

### Description

`EASI` implements features of estimation statistics and data visualization. Its primary functions describe, estimate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, correlations, and standardized effect sizes in between- and within-subjects single-factor, factorial, and mixed designs. Additional functions offer summaries and plots of data, frequencies, densities, and more. Most functions can take either raw data or summary statistics as input.
