## Technical Details

### Calculations and Explanations

For means, mean differences, and mean contrasts:

- Confidence intervals are calculated independent of each other (i.e., they are not simultaneous)
- No corrections for multiple intervals/contrasts are made
- All calculations assume heterogenity of variance

For standardized effect sizes:

- All effect sizes are calculated as standardized comparisons (Cohen's d) or as standardized contrasts (see Bonett, 2008)
- Confidence intervals for standardized comparisons and contrasts are based on Bonett's (2008) method.
