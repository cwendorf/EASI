## Between-Subjects Example with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of this Example

The **BetweenSubjects** documents and files analyze an example of a single-factor between-subjects design.

- The example is duplicated both using raw data input and summary statistics input
- The example includes estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- The example contains a data file, a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Details of this Example

The [**BETWEEN-SUBJECTS-DATA-EXAMPLE.md**](./BETWEEN-SUBJECTS-DATA-EXAMPLE.md) file uses raw data input.  
The [**BETWEEN-SUBJECTS-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md**](./BETWEEN-SUBJECTS-SUMMARY-EXAMPLE.md) file uses summary statistics input.

These analyses include the following:

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Group Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis of two levels of a factor)
- Analyses of a Group Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all levels of a factor)
