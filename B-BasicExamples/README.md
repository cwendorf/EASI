# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## Basic Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Examples

- There are basic example files for between-subjects desgins and for within-subjects designs
- The examples provide a simple data set for each design
- The examples show both the default output and the available options
- The examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes

### Included Examples

The file **BasicBetweenSubjectsExamples.R** includes:

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Group Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis of two levels of a factor)
- Analyses of a Group Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all levels of a factor)

The file **BasicWithinSubjectsExamples.R** includes:

- Analyses of Mutiple Variables (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each instance of a variable)
- Analyses of Variable Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis two instances of a variable)
- Analyses of a Variable Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all instances of a variable)
