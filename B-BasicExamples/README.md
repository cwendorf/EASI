## Basic Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Examples

- Basic example files for between-subjects designs and for within-subjects designs are included
- The examples are duplicated using raw data input and summary statistics input
- The examples show both the default output and the available options
- The examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes
- Each example provides a syntax file, a text output file, and graphs

### Included Examples

The [**BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md**](./BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md) uses raw data input.

The [**BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./BETWEEN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) uses summary statistics input.

Both documents and the associated files include:

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Group Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis of two levels of a factor)
- Analyses of a Group Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all levels of a factor)

The [**WITHIN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md**](./WITHIN_SUBJECTS_DATA_EXAMPLE.md) uses raw data input.

The [**WITHIN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md**](./WITHIN_SUBJECTS_SUMMARY_EXAMPLE.md) uses summary statistics input.

Both documents and the associated files include:

- Analyses of Mutiple Variables (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each instance of a variable)
- Analyses of Variable Differences (equivalent to a comparison analysis two instances of a variable)
- Analyses of a Variable Contrast (equivalent to a contrast analysis of all instances of a variable)
