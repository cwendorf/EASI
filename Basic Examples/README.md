# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## Basic Examples

### Overview of the Examples

- There is one basic example file for Between-Subjects and one for Within-Subjects designs
- Examples provide a simple data set for each design
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes

### Included Examples

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Comparisons/Differences (equivalent to analyses for two levels of a factor)
- Analyses of Set of Contrasts (equivalent to dummy, effect, and other sets of codes)
- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to Tukey LSD pairwise comparisons)
