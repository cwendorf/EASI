# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

## Basic Examples with Simple Fictional Data

### Overview of the Examples

- There are basic example files for between-subjects desgins and for within-subjects designs
- Examples provide a simple data set for each design
- Examples show both the default output and the available options
- Examples include estimation, plots, significance tests, and effect sizes

### Included Examples

The file **Basic Between-Subjects Examples.R** includes:

- Analyses of Mutiple Groups (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each level of a factor)
- Analyses of Comparisons/Differences (equivalent to analyses for two levels or subsets of a factor)
- Analyses of Set of Contrasts (equivalent to dummy, effect, and other sets of contrasts among all levels of a factor)
- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to Tukey LSD pairwise comparisons among all levels of a factor)

The file **Basic Writhin-Subjects Examples.R** includes:

- Analyses of Mutiple Variables (equivalent to one-sample analyses for each instance of a variable)
- Analyses of Comparisons/Differences (equivalent to analyses of differences for two instances or subsets of a variable)
- Analyses of Set of Contrasts (equivalent to dummy, effect, and other sets of codes among all instances of a variable)
- Analyses of Pairwise Comparisons (equivalent to Tukey LSD pairwise comparisons of all instances of a variable)
