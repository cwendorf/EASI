## Overview of EASI

EASI is a set of fast and flexible scripts for R that implement features of [estimation statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics "Estimation Stats on Wikipedia"). These functions calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means, mean comparisons, and standardized effect sizes. Functions and extensions are available for different single-factor between- and within-subjects single-factor, factorial, and mixed designs and can take either raw data or summary statistics as input. Numerous tutorials and other examples from textbooks are available.

### EASI for Individual Groups and Variables

EASI can be used to calculate and plot confidence intervals for the means of groups (in a between-subjects design) or instances of a variable (in a within-subjects design). Additional functions can show the standardized effect sizes and statistical significance tests associated with the groups and variables.

### EASI for Group and Variable Comparisons

EASI can be used to calculate and plot confidence intervals of mean differences and mean contrasts for independent groups (between-subjects design) or paired means (within-subjects designs). Additional functions can show the standardized effect sizes and statistical significance tests for the designated comparison.
