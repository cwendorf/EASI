# EASI (Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference)

EASI is a set of fast and simple R functions that calculate confidence intervals for means and standardized effect sizes, the later of which are not available in more elaborate commercially available statistical software. Separate functions are available for different designs (between-subjects vs. within-subjects).
