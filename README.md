# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

EASI is a set of fast and simple scripts for R that implement basic features of [estimation statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics "Estimation Stats on Wikipedia"). These scripts calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means and standardized effect sizes. Functions and examples are available for different designs (between-subjects vs. within-subjects). All scripts and examples are updated frequently.
