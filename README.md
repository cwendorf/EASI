# Estimation Approach to Statistical Inference (EASI)

EASI is a set of fast and simple scripts for R that implement basic features of [estimation statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics "Estimation Stats on Wikipedia"). These scripts calculate, test, and plot confidence intervals for means and standardized effect sizes, the later of which are not available in most commercially available statistical software. Functions and examples are available for different designs (between-subjects vs. within-subjects). All scripts and examples are updated frequently.
